# Python-Text-MMORPG
A text MMORPG built completely in Python. This is a really early version of the base code. I haven't yet thought much over how the game itself (the story, game mechanics etc.). For now there won't be a server being hosted, but you can try out the server and client on your localhost. The instructions are in the README
